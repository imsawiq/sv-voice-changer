/**
 * Analogue-style octave divider: the chest layer behind the Batman, Titan and
 * Demon voices.
 *
 * <p>The input is band-limited to the fundamental region, a flip-flop toggles
 * on every upward zero crossing to produce a square at half the input
 * frequency, and that square is multiplied back into the filtered signal. The
 * product carries a strong component one octave below the voice, which is then
 * smoothed and level-matched to the input envelope.</p>
 *
 * <p>The predecessor advanced a sine phase by half a period on every sign
 * change of the full-band signal. On real speech the sign changes constantly
 * on noise, so the "sub" tracked nothing and mostly added grit. Deriving the
 * divider from a low-passed copy is what makes it track the actual voice.</p>
