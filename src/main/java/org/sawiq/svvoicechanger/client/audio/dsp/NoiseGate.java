/**
 * Downward expander used as a speech gate.
 *
 * <p>Runs first in the chain so that room tone, fan noise and keyboard bleed
 * never reach the pitch shifter. That matters more here than in a normal
 * mixer: a phase vocoder turns steady broadband noise into an audible warble,
 * so gating afterwards would be too late.</p>
 *
 * <p>Open and close thresholds differ by a fixed hysteresis, and the gate
 * holds open briefly after the signal drops, so quiet consonants at the end of
 * a word are not chopped off.</p>
