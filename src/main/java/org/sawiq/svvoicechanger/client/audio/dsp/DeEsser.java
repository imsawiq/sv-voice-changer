 * Split-band de-esser.

 * <p>Shifting a voice upwards moves sibilance up with it, which is why raised
 * presets sound sharp without one. The band above {@value #CROSSOVER_HZ} Hz is
 * separated with a one-pole crossover, chosen because low plus high sums back
 * to exactly the input so a bypassed de-esser stays transparent. Its level is
 * compared against the body of the voice and only the excess is attenuated,
 * which keeps ordinary consonants crisp instead of lisping.</p>
